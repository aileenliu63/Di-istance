Our Hackathon Project uses geofencing to prevent overcrowding of areas in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID 19. The way this works, and owner of a business decide they don't want more than a certain amount of people in an area they can set the area using longitude and latitude coordinates, the radius around that point, and the maximum amount of people allowed in that area. The Geofence tracks how many people enter an exit the area and has a count of the amount of people in the area and can send an alert when there are too many people.

We were able have a customer set the geofence using the app and have the app register when people are in the geofenced area. In order to make this app a completed project we wanted to use firebase cloud from google to register all instances of people being in the geofenced area in order to have a count of how many people were in the geofenced area at a time. However, we did not have enough time. We were able to create a firebase database and add it to the app but couldn't implement the counter in time.
